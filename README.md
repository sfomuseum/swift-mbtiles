# MBTiles

## Important

THIS DOES NOT WORK YET. Specifically:

* It is still hardcoded to expect `UIKit` -related things.
* Working with Swift packages pre XCode 11 is still a nuisance.

Also, it's not really a generic MBTile package 
This package exists, right now, mostly so we can start chipping away at the above and to more easily clone/update code between the `webkit` and `mapkit` branches of [ios-sfomuseum-maps-t2](https://bitbucket.org/flysfo/ios-sfomuseum-maps-t2/src/master/).
